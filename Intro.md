In the field of public policy and administration, there have been
several enduring questions.  In a larger context, what is the role of
government?  There has always been conflict in our society regarding the
proper role of government.  How should public organizations be
structured to reflect the will of the public?  How do we ensure
accountability?  What is the proper role of the public
administrator/analyst in policy implementation?  How should programs be
evaluated? This course will provide you with an overview of the field of
public administration, particularly the distinctions that set management
of public organizations apart from that of private-sector
organizations.  You will begin with an examination of the history and
perception of the role of government in the provision of services.  You
will then examine the context in which public administrators deliver
services to citizens.  Public administrators must also possess a basic
knowledge of managing organizations and people in order to implement
policy—this includes an understanding of organization theory, personnel
administration, budgeting, and the administration and evaluation of
policies and programs.  By the end of this course, you will gain a
broader understanding of public organizations, the administration of
public programs, and a greater appreciation for public service.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC241: Introduction to Public Administration.  Below,
please find general information on this course and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Heather Wyatt-Nichol, PhD  
  
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a wide range of free
online materials, including U.S. Supreme Court decisions and
publications from the National Academy of Public Administration and the
U.S. Government Accountability Office.  
  
 **Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all its assigned materials. 
This includes self-assessments at the end of each unit.  You will also
have a final exam once you have completed all units.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources and self-assessments in each unit.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course shouldtake approximately **132.5
hours** to complete apart from the self-assessments and final exam. 
Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of time you
are expected to commit to each subunit.  It may be useful to take a look
at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take 17.75 hours.  Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2
(a total of 3.75 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 5.25
hours) on Tuesday and Wednesday nights; etc.
