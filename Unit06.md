**Unit 6: Program Planning and Evaluation** <span id="6"></span> 
*Taxpayers want to know if their money is producing a return on their
investment in the “public good.”  The Government Performance Results Act
(GPRA) of 1993 required federal agencies to develop strategic plans and
measure performance of the agency and its programs.  Several states have
also implemented similar legislation.  The GPRA Modernization Act of
2010 revised the reporting process and requirements.  This unit
addresses the importance of planning and evaluation in public
organizations.  Strategic planning techniques, performance measurement,
and methods of program evaluation are presented.*
