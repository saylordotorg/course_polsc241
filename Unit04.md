**Unit 4: Public Management** <span id="4"></span> 
*The traditional model of public administration – characterized by
Weber’s theory of bureaucracy, Woodrow Wilson’s politics/administration
dichotomy, and Taylor’s theory of scientific management – attempted to
create a structure of public administration that was free from political
interference, value neutral, and structured in a way that would ensure
both accountability and efficiency.  The fallacies in the traditional
model have been challenged as the field of public administration has
progressed.  This unit explores the progression of management thought
and practice within the field.*
