**Unit 1: Introduction to Public Administration** <span id="1"></span> 
*Because public organizations use public resources to make decisions
that affect society, several important questions emerge in determining
how the will of the people should be converted into action.  One of the
most important questions is: how should public organizations be
structured to represent societal values and ensure democratic
accountability?  A historical account of dominant eras in the field of
public administration represents a progression of diverse perspectives.*
