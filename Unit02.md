**Unit 2: Intergovernmental Relations** <span id="2"></span> 
*Within a broader context of public administration, it is important to
understand the dynamic process that affects the changing role of
government.  The role of government is of particular relevance, because
the decisions made through the political process determine the
environment in which a public administrator will carry out policy.  The
legitimacy of the role of government is expressed through policies or
programs created to represent the demands of the majority.  In addition,
overlap of jurisdictional boundaries and the concurrent powers inherent
in the U.S. federal system create unique complexities for public
administrators.*
